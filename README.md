# Predicting-Recidivism-through-survival-models
Developed a survival analysis model to predict  recidivism risk using the COMPAS dataset. Applied KaplanMeier, Cox  Proportional Hazards, and Random Survival Forest techniques to analyze time to-reoffense while addressing data biases and fairness concerns. Data preprocessing, and visualization to enhance model  interpretability and reliability
