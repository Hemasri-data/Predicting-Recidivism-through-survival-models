# Predicting-Recidivism-through-survival-models
Developed a survival analysis model to predict recidivism risk using the COMPAS dataset. Applied KaplanMeier, Cox Proportional Hazards, and Random Survival Forest techniques to analyze time to-reoffense while addressing data biases and fairness concerns. Data preprocessing, and visualization to enhance model interpretability and reliability.
